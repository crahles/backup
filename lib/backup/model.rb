    ##
    # [Package]
    # After all the database dumps and archives are placed inside
    # the folder, it'll make a single .tar package (archive) out of it
    ##
    # [Encryption]
    # Optionally encrypts the packaged file with one or more encryptors
    ##
    # [Compression]
    # Optionally compresses the packaged file with one or more compressors
    ##
    # [Storages]
    # Runs all (if any) storage objects to store the backups to remote locations
    # and (if configured) it'll cycle the files on the remote location to limit the
    # amount of backups stored on each individual location
    ##
    # [Syncers]
    # Runs all (if any) sync objects to store the backups to remote locations.
    # A Syncer does not go through the process of packaging, compressing, encrypting backups.
    # A Syncer directly transfers data from the filesystem to the remote location
    ##
    # [Notifiers]
    # Runs all (if any) notifier objects when a backup proces finished with or without
    # any errors.
    ##
    # [Cleaning]
    # After the whole backup process finishes, it'll go ahead and remove any temporary
    # file that it produced. If an exception(error) is raised during this process which
    # breaks the process, it'll always ensure it removes the temporary files regardless
    # to avoid mass consumption of storage space on the machine
